            <h3 class="cs-h3">Lean design. No templates.</h3>
            <p class="cs-text">
                At Website3000, we do things differently. While others rely on WordPress and page builders that load slowly and require constant maintenance, I hand-write every line of code—not many developers do this anymore. Just clean HTML, CSS, JavaScript that delivers instant loading.<br><br>
                This approach eliminates bloated code and elevates the user experience — which leads to higher conversions.<br><br>
                On our sites you also won't see complex animations, fancy graphics, heavy images or slideshows — these components slow you down. Here, design and development is all about being lean and fast.

            <p class="cs-text">
                It's very competitive online. Ranking on Google takes time, so good user experience matters. Nobody can promise you pole position overnight but we can certainly improve your odds of being seen by the right audience.<br><br>
                Two simple ways to improve your ranking :<br><br>
                1. The most direct way is being faster. Between two similar sites with similar content and domain authority, Google favours the one with better PageSpeed scores and Core Web Vitals.<br><br>
                2. When users search with keywords and find you, you want to keep them on your website. If it's well-structured, well-written and responsive, they engage more and navigate to internal links (Longer sessions also make them more likely to contact you).<br><br>
                Higher engagement and click-through rates signal to Google that your content is valuable — this improves your ranking and creates a positive feedback loop.

                WordPress, while popular, presents challenges for AI. Its complex database structure, plugin dependencies, and bloated code make it harder for AI systems to parse content efficiently. Security vulnerabilities, the need for constant updates, and performance issues prevent websites from being prioritized in AI-powered search.

                    WordPress sites create multiple attack vectors through databases, plugins, and server-side processing. Hackers target WordPress because it's everywhere, and vulnerabilities are well-documented. Miss an update, and you're exposed.<br><br>
                    Static sites eliminate these risks entirely because their architecture itself is the security. Without databases, server-side code or plugins, there's simply nothing for hackers to exploit. Just clean HTML, CSS and JavaScript files delivered via superfast CDN (Content Delivery Network).
