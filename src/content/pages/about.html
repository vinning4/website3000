                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        Hi, I'm Vin. A former bioengineer and molecular biologist with a background in product design and manufacturing, I bring an engineer's mindset to web development. Formally trained in front-end development, I build websites because I genuinely enjoy coding. I'm most drawn to the technical art of web development : writing precise code to achieve 100/100 performance scores, and connecting a site with its right audience.<br><br>
                        Working from my home office in Melbourne, I run <i>Website3000</i> with the simple goal of delivering quality work without the notorious agency markup. I've distilled my practice to what genuinely moves the needle for businesses.

            </li>
            <li class="cs-item">
                <div class="cs-item-wrapper">
                    <h3 class="cs-h3">
                        About Your Site: First Impressions Matter
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                         Good website design turns visitors into buyers. Most businesses just need 3 to 5 clean, fast-loading pages but the two options disappoint: Cut-rate 'WordPress experts' who commoditize bloated templates, or pricey agencies flaunting jargon.<br><br>
                         Both miss the point — your website isn't a vanity project, it's digital real estate working 24/7 to build trust.
                         <br><br>
                         Yes, anyone can 'have a website' using DIY builders — this is like printing a sign to stick above your shop. It proves you exist, but does it do anything to find customers and guide them to buy? Does it appear before competitors' sites? How fast does it load? And on mobiles? Have you told Google how to find and rank your site?
                         <br><br>
                         These things matter if you want your website to actually bring in customers. A strategically built, SEO-driven site is more like having a trained sales team : it helps the right people find you, answers their questions, and guides them to contact you.

                        How I Work
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        I focus on what matters : Fast-loading sites that maximize business potential — and look great on any device. I write every line of code in semantic HTML/CSS/JS without using templates or frameworks (Few developers do this anymore). Hard-coding a website like this requires a higher level of coding knowledge but gives complete control over the look and functionality. This code is also scalable, reliable, secure, and optimized for both search engines and AI crawlers. No bloated templates, no unnecessary plugins, no databases to hack, no mobile formatting glitches.<br><br>
                        Since Google prioritizes quality content, I give equal attention to crafting compelling copy tailored to your business. This includes weekly blog posts, available as an optional add-on.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        Direct partnership with premium-quality results. When you call or email, you reach me—no phone trees, no call centres. The subscription model acknowledges small business economics rather than exploiting it, giving you predictable prices that make sense. I look after updates and SEO so that you can focus on what you do best.
