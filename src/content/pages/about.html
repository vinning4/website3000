                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        Hi, I'm Vin. A former bioengineer and molecular biologist with a background in product design and manufacturing, I bring an engineer's mindset to web development. Formally trained in front-end development, I build websites because I genuinely enjoy coding.<br><br>
                        I also like working with small businesses. Working from my home office in Melbourne, I run <i>Website3000</i> with the simple goal of delivering quality work without the notorious agency markup. I've distilled my practice to what genuinely moves the needle for businesses.

                        About Your Site: First Impressions Matter
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                         A good website does more than look professional. It helps the right people find you, understand what you do, and take the next step. Most businesses just need 3 to 5 clean, fast-loading pages. Yet the common options disappoint: low-cost WordPress setups built on bloated templates, or expensive agencies wrapped in jargon and process.<br><br>
                         Both miss the point — your website isn't a vanity project, it's digital real estate working 24/7 to build trust.
                         <br><br>
                         Yes, anyone can publish a website using DIY page builders. This is like putting up a signboard: It proves you exist. But does it find and attract qualifed visitors or guide them to buy? Does it appear before competitors' sites in search results? How fast does it load? And on mobiles? Has Google been told how to find and rank your site?
                         <br><br>
                         These things matter for websites to actually bring in customers. A strategically built, performance-focused site functions like a trained sales team: it helps the right people find you, answers their questions, and guides them to contact you.

                        How I Work
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        I focus on what matters: Fast-loading sites that maximize business potential — and look great on any device. I write every line of code in semantic HTML/CSS/JS without using templates or frameworks (Few developers do this anymore). Hard-coding a website like this requires a higher level of coding knowledge but gives complete control over the look and functionality. This code is also scalable, reliable, secure, and optimized for both search engines and AI crawlers. No bloated templates, no unnecessary plugins, no databases to hack, no mobile formatting glitches.<br><br>
                        Since Google prioritizes quality content, I give equal attention to crafting compelling copy tailored to your business. This includes weekly or fortnightly blog posts, available as an optional add-on.

                        What You Get
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                         A performance-focused, professional website that loads quickly, responsively adapts to all devices, and communicates clearly to both people and search engines like Google.<br><br>
                         You also get a direct partnership with the developer designing and building your site. When you call or email, you reach me—no phone trees, no call centres. The subscription model acknowledges small business economics rather than exploiting it, giving you predictable prices that make sense. I look after updates, SEO and site maintenance so you can focus on what you do best.
