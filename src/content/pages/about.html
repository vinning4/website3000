                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        I'm Vin. With a background in bioengineering, molecular biology and product design, I approach web development as an engineering problem—applying systems thinking to structure and purpose. Formally trained in front-end development, I build websites because I genuinely enjoy coding.<br><br>
                        <i>Website3000</i> exists because modern websites are often over-designed but underperform, and I like fixing them for small businesses. Based in Melbourne AU, I operate an independent practice focused on web work that reliably serves businesses—without agency markup.

                        About Your Site: What Matters
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        A good website functions as a commercial instrument. It helps the right audience find you, understand your offer quickly, and act. For most businesses, this requires just 3 to 5 fast, well-structured pages. Yet the prevailing options fall short: bloated, template-driven WordPress builds, usually low cost, or agencies encumbered by process, overhead, and jargon—usually expensive. Both miss the point. Your website isn't a vanity project, it's digital real estate tasked with earning trust.
                        <br><br>
                        Publishing a DIY site is easy, but effectiveness emerges under scrutiny: does it attract qualified visitors, load quickly across devices, and send clear signals to Google? When built with technical discipline, a website becomes a durable asset.

                        How I Work
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                        I focus on what matters: Fast-loading sites that maximize business potential—and look great on any device. I write every line of code in semantic HTML/CSS/JS without using templates or frameworks (Few developers do this anymore). Hard-coding a website like this requires a higher level of coding knowledge but gives complete control over the look and functionality. This code is also scalable, reliable, secure, and optimized for both search engines and AI crawlers. No bloated templates, no unnecessary plugins, no databases to hack, no mobile formatting glitches.<br><br>
                        Since Google prioritizes quality content, I give equal attention to crafting compelling copy tailored to your business. This includes weekly or fortnightly blog posts, available as an optional add-on.

                        What You Get
                    </h3>
                    <p class="cs-item-text">
                         A performance-focused, professional website that loads quickly, responsively adapts to all devices, and communicates clearly to both people and search engines like Google.
                         <br><br>
                         You also get direct customer service if you have questions. When you call or email, you reach me—no call centres. The subscription model acknowledges small business economics, giving you predictable prices that make sense. I look after updates, SEO and site maintenance so you can focus on what you do best.
