            <li class="cs-faq-item active">

                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        How does website subscription work?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Think of it like a mobile plan or Netflix—pay monthly, enjoy full access. Cancel anytime to end the service.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead of the traditional web design model with a large upfront build fee (typically $5,000–$15,000) and separate fees for edits and maintenance, the subscription spreads out your cost. You get a professionally built website <i>and</i> a dedicated on-call developer supporting your site — hosting, updates, edits, SEO improvements, security are all included.
                    <br><br>
                    Most clients like this because they don't have to think about the technical side at all. There's no chasing developers, no surprise invoices, and no need to manage hosting or updates yourself.
                    <br><br>
                    You're free to cancel at any time. If the subscription ends, the service ends too, and the site is taken offline (as it's no longer being maintained or hosted on servers). If you'd prefer to own the website outright later, a buyout option is available after the initial term.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">
                <button class="cs-button">
                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        What's the minimum subscription length?
                    </span>

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    12 months. After that, it continues month to month.
                    <br><br>
                    No setup fees, no exit fees, no fine print. The initial period simply allows enough time for the site to be properly established — from performance to search visibility — so you're not paying for something that hasn't had time to do its job.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">
                <button class="cs-button">
                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        How come your prices are lower than others?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Most agencies carry significant overheads — sales teams, office space, layers of staff. I work as a solo specialist, so these costs simply don't exist.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything is built and maintained by me, end to end. That means hand-coded, responsive websites focused on speed and reliability. No account managers, call queues, or internal handoffs.
                    <br><br>
                    The subscription model also acknowledges small business economics. Spreading the cost over time and providing direct access to the builder makes professional web work more accessible and predictable. It's designed to be efficient and practical — not cheap.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">

                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        What's this about Google PSI scores?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    PSI = PageSpeed Insights. It's a Google tool that evaluates website performance on mobile and desktop. Page speed affects user experience and is a confirmed search ranking signal, since slow sites increase abandonment. Scores above 90 are considered strong; 95–100 indicates a high level of optimisation.

                        Why not build a website myself?

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    You certainly can. There are several online tools to get started quickly and cheaply.<br><br>
                    Where the difference emerges is after launch. DIY sites are designed to help you publish pages; professionally built sites are designed for business results. That distinction decides how reliably you get visitors, and whether they convert to enquiries. This is explained better here: <a href="/blog/diy-sites/"><i>The Conversion Ceiling of DIY Websites</i></a>.<br><br>
                    If you're not ready to invest in a professional website yet, you can start with a Google Business Profile and active social media pages. These free tools can help you get found online while you decide on your website strategy.

                        How can the website potentially pay for itself?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    If your website generates just one new customer per month worth $150 or more, the subscription effectively covers itself.
                    <br><br>
                    For many service businesses such as trades and professional services, a single new customer is often worth several hundred dollars, which means the website doesn't need high traffic to generate positive returns.

        <!--Added second UL, this allows you to open an FAQ item on each side without messing up the flexbox for the other -->
        <ul class="cs-faq-group">
            <li class="cs-faq-item">
                <button class="cs-button">
                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        What are the advantages of custom code over WordPress?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Done right, custom code can be simple and powerful. It helps strip a website down to its essentials and build only what's needed — without relying on themes, templates, plugins or databases. In other words, disciplined engineering over convenience.
                    <br><br>
                    This has practical advantages: fast loading, fewer security risks and efficient code management for future refinements. There are no plugin conflicts, no databases to hack, no surprise breakdowns, no sudden mandatory upgrades, and no unnecessary bloat slowing down the site.
                    <br><br>
                    For businesses, this means a website that loads instantly, works reliably on all devices, and has predictable costs over time — without the overhead that often comes with WordPress setups.

                        How do I choose between subscription and the upfront option?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    <b>Choose the subscription if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer smaller, predictable monthly costs and $0 upfront<br>
                    Prefer ongoing help with edits, updates, maintenance<br>
                    Don't want to deal with hosting, security, or technical issues<br>
                    Like having a developer quietly keeping things running<br><br>
                    <b>Choose the one-time payment if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer to pay upfront and own the website from day one<br>
                    Can manage hosting and updates yourself<br>
                    Can make content changes independently after launch<br><br>
                    Both options result in the same quality website. The difference is how much ongoing involvement you prefer. Most clients choose the subscription for its simplicity and peace of mind.<br>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">

                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        With subscription, do I pay more in the long run?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Not necessarily — it depends on what you need.<br><br>
                    The subscription is an ongoing service, not a payment plan for a website.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>One-time build ($3,000):</b> For those who need a website and are happy to manage the code files after launch — hosting, updates, content changes, future improvements.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Subscription ($150/month):</b> You're paying for both the website <i>and</i> an experienced developer taking care of it over time. Hosting, content edits, performance monitoring, security updates, SEO improvements, and even a future redesign are all included.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The difference:</b> Over time, the subscription replaces costs that are often separate and unpredictable: hourly developer fees for small changes, maintenance, hosting, and fixes. Many businesses reach a similar total spend either way — the difference is that here, everything is handled for you.
                    <br><br>
                    There's no long-term lock-in. If the subscription no longer makes sense for your business, you can cancel after the initial period. If you'd prefer to keep the website going without a subscription, a buyout option is available.
                    <br><br>
                    For businesses that value simplicity and continuity, the subscription is usually the more practical choice. For those who prefer full ownership from day one, the one-time build is available.

            <li class="cs-faq-item">

                        What happens when I cancel the subscription after 12 months?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    When the subscription ends, hosting and maintenance stop, and the website is taken offline — because the service that keeps it running is no longer active.
                    <br><br>
                    Your domain name is always yours to keep.
                    <br><br>
                    If you'd prefer to continue using the website without a subscription, you can choose to purchase it outright via a buyout option. This gives you full ownership of the code files, and you're free to host or manage the site elsewhere.
                </p>

                    This means your site is structured in a way search engines can easily understand — clear page hierarchy, well-written titles and descriptions, fast load times, mobile-friendly layouts, and clean code. Images are optimised, pages are linked logically, and local business information is included so search engines know what you do and where you're based.
                    <br><br>
                    If you choose the optional blog add-on, SEO can improve further over time. Regular, well-written articles give search engines fresh content to index, help answer common customer questions, and gradually build topical relevance in your industry.
                    <br><br>
                    SEO isn't instant—but a fast, well-structured website gives you a strong foundation to grow visibility organically.

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    A blog isn't required, but it can be very effective.
                    <br><br>
                    Done well, blogging supports SEO by adding useful pages for search engines to index and by covering topics your customers are actively searching for. It also helps build trust by answering common questions and demonstrating expertise, which removes uncertainty before a visitor gets in touch.
                    <br><br>
                    For a blog to be effective, it needs to be consistent — usually 2 to 4 posts per month — with genuinely helpful content rather than filler.
                    <br><br>
                    The optional blog add-on provides this without requiring your time. Posts are researched, articulate, and optimised for performance and search visibility, with relevant images compressed for fast loading.
