        <ul class="cs-faq-group">
            <!-- Active class added as default -->
            <li class="cs-faq-item active">

                        How does website subscription work?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Think of it like Spotify or Netflix—pay monthly, enjoy the service. Traditional web design means paying $5,000–$10,000 upfront, then you're on your own for updates, edits, maintenance, hosting.<br><br>
                    Our subscription model flips this : small monthly payments give you a live website plus unlimited edits, hosting, automatic security patches as technology evolves, SEO updates, and even optional weekly blog content—all included so you get back your time and focus on growing your business.<br><br>
                    <b>You can cancel anytime and the site goes offline.</b> This model lets us stay in business without charging you thousands upfront, plus you get ongoing support instead of the usual 'build-and-forget' approach. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">

                        What's the minimum subscription length?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    12-month minimum, then month-to-month. Cancel anytime after the first year, the site goes offline (you keep your domain, of course).<br><br>
                    No setup fees, no exit fees, no lock-in contracts. We work with business owners who understand that SEO and Google rankings take time to build.

                        How come your prices are lower than others?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Traditional agencies charge massive upfront fees to cover sales teams, office rent and layers of staff. I'm a solo specialist without those overheads. Working from my Melbourne home office, I focus entirely on what you're paying for : hand-coded websites that load fast. No bloated team or fancy office. No <i>"Press 3 for support"</i> — just direct access to the developer actually building your site.<br><br>
                    Moreover, small businesses don't always have thousands to spend on a new project. With a monthly subscription, your website can potentially generate leads and pay for itself. This makes the subscription model efficient, not cheap.

                        What's this about Google PSI scores?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    PSI = PageSpeed Insights. It's a Google tool that evaluates website performance on mobile and desktop. Page speed affects user experience and is a confirmed search ranking signal, since slow sites increase abandonment. Scores above 90 are considered strong; 95–100 indicates a high level of optimisation.

                        How can the website potentially pay for itself?

                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    With a monthly subscription, if your website brings in just one new customer worth $150 (or more) each month, it pays for itself! For tradesmen and accountants, each new customer is potentially worth several hundred dollars.

                        What are the advantages of custom code over WordPress?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    <b>Speed & Performance:</b> Custom-coded websites load in under 1 second, while WordPress sites typically take 3 to 5+ seconds. 53% of mobile users bounce after 3 seconds, so this impacts your conversions.<br><br>
                    <b>Security:</b> Static websites cannot be hacked because there's no database or login system. WordPress powers 43% of websites but accounts for 90%+ of hacked sites due to plugins/themes.<br><br>
                    <b>No Ongoing Headaches:</b> You won't deal with plugin updates, device compatibility issues, or surprise breakdowns. Your site just works.<br><br>
                    <b>Better Google Rankings:</b> Fast-loading sites rank higher in search results, helping more customers find your business.<br><br>
                    <b>True Mobile Optimization:</b> Custom code ensures your site looks perfect on every device, not just "good enough" like many WordPress themes.<br><br>
                    <b>Predictable Costs:</b> No mystery fees or sudden mandatory upgrades, you know exactly what you're paying.<br><br>
                    The bottom line: WordPress might seem cheaper upfront, but custom code delivers better results for your business and saves you headaches long-term.

                        How do I choose between subscription and the upfront option?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    <b>Choose subscription if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer smaller, predictable monthly costs and $0 upfront<br>
                    Prefer ongoing support for edits, updates, maintenance<br>
                    Prefer someone else handling technical issues<br>
                    Want hosting and security monitoring included<br><br>
                    <b>Choose the one-time payment if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer to pay in full and own your website outright<br>
                    Can manage your own hosting and updates to contact forms etc<br>
                    Plan to make content changes yourself<br><br>
                    With subscription, the site goes offline if you cancel, but may pay for itself if you stay on (Most clients choose this).<br>
                    With the upfront option, you own your website and pay less in the long run.

                    </span>

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    After two years, yes—because you're paying for different things..
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Upfront option ($3,000):</b> For those who need a website but don't need someone to manage it.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Subscription ($150/month):</b> You get a website <i>plus</i> an on-call developer for content edits, hosting, security patches, SEO improvements, performance monitoring, and an optional site redesign after 3 years.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>The math:</b> If your website brings in just one new customer worth $150 each month, it pays for itself! To our clients, their subscription is a marketing expense that generates returns, not just a cost.
                    <br><br>
                    We break even around year 2–3. You get premium ongoing value without extra work and without being charged a larger amount upfront.

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Your site goes offline, you keep your domain name. Even if we purchased the domain for you, ownership will be transferred to you so you can start over with someone else for a new website.

                    Both pricing options include on-page <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization.<br><br>
                    This involves optimized page structure, title hierarchy, tags and descriptions that Google can easily scan. I use image compression, internal linking strategies, content silos, responsive design techniques, lazy loading, and clean, mobile-friendly code for fast loading. I also include local business markup so Google knows your location and can decide how to rank your website.<br><br>
                    The optional blog add-on can significantly improve SEO – you get 3 to 5 high quality blog posts every month that include targeted keywords and position your business as an authority in your industry. Search engines value blogs because they provide fresh, relevant content that adds indexed pages, addresses customer questions, and boosts organic traffic over time.

                        Do I need a blog for my website?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    A blog helps your business in two main ways. First, it improves SEO by giving Google more pages to index, targeting keywords your customers search for, and showing your site is active and up-to-date. Second, it builds trust by demonstrating your expertise and addressing common customer questions—saving you time from answering them repeatedly.<br><br>
                    For best results, blogs need consistent posting (2–4 times per month) with content that genuinely helps your audience. With regular posts, a blog becomes one of your most valuable marketing tools.<br><br>
                    <b>Our blog add-on</b> includes 3–5 blog posts per month, so you get the benefits without the time investment needed to write them yourself. Each post is thoroughly researched and crafted to be both articulate and compelling, no matter how niche your industry. Appropriate pictures and graphics are included as needed, with image compression for fast loading. This ensures your content addresses search terms your potential customers are actually using, positioning you as the expert they're looking for.
