                        How does website subscription work?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Think of it like Spotify or Netflix—pay monthly, enjoy full access. Cancel anytime to end the service.
                    <br><br>
                    Traditional web design typically involves a large upfront payment ($5,000–$15,000) with separate costs for hosting and maintenance. Once the site is delivered, support ends and future updates/edits are billed by the hour.
                    <br><br>
                    The monthly subscription flips this: In addition to a fully built website, you get a dedicated on-call developer supporting your site—hosting, updates, edits, SEO improvements, security are all included. Plus an optional blog add-on. Clients like having someone to look after the technical side so they can focus on their business.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>You can cancel anytime—this ends the service and the site goes offline</b> (as it's no longer being maintained or hosted on servers). This structure reduces your upfront costs and ensures the website continues to perform rather than stagnate.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li class="cs-faq-item">
                <button class="cs-button">
                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        What's the minimum subscription length?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    The minimum subscription is 12 months. After that, it continues month to month and can be cancelled at any time. Upon cancellation, the website goes offline (You keep your domain, of course).
                    <br><br>
                    No setup fees, no exit fees, and no lock-in contracts beyond the first year. The initial period exists because search visibility and performance improvements take time to establish.
                </p>

                        How come your prices are lower than others?
                    </span>

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Traditional agencies have overheads: sales teams, office rent, layers of staff. I'm a solo specialist. Working from my Melbourne home office, I focus entirely on the task: hand-coded, responsive websites that load fast. No account managers, no call queues, no internal handoffs.
                    <br><br>
                    The monthly subscription model also acknowledges small business economics: it's often hard to spend thousands on a new project. When the costs are spread over time, your website can potentially generate leads and pay for itself. This makes the subscription model efficient and practical, not cheap.

                        What's this about Google PSI scores?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    PSI = PageSpeed Insights. It's a Google tool that evaluates website performance on mobile and desktop. Page speed affects user experience and is a confirmed search ranking signal, since slow sites increase abandonment. Scores above 90 are considered strong; 95–100 indicates a high level of optimisation.

                        Why not build a website myself?
                    </span>

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    You certainly can, and there are several online tools to get started quickly and cheaply.<br><br>
                    Where the difference emerges is after launch. DIY sites are designed to help you publish pages; professionally built sites are designed for business results. That distinction decides how reliably you get visitors, and whether they convert to enquiries. This is explained better here: <a href="/blog/diy-sites/"><i>The Conversion Ceiling of DIY Websites</i></a>.</a><br><br>
                    If you're not ready to invest in a professional website yet, you can start with a Google Business Profile and active social media pages. These free tools can help you get found online while you decide on your website strategy.

                        How can the website potentially pay for itself?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    With a monthly subscription, if your website brings in just one new customer worth $150 (or more) each month, it pays for itself! For tradesmen and accountants, each new customer is potentially worth several hundred dollars.

                    <span class="cs-button-text">
                        What are the advantages of custom code over WordPress?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    <b>Speed & Performance:</b> Custom-coded websites load in under 1 second, while WordPress sites typically take 3 to 5+ seconds. 53% of mobile users bounce after 3 seconds, so this impacts your conversions.<br><br>
                    <b>Security:</b> Static websites cannot be hacked because there's no database or login system. WordPress powers 43% of websites but accounts for 90%+ of hacked sites due to plugins/themes.<br><br>
                    <b>No Ongoing Headaches:</b> You won't deal with plugin updates, device compatibility issues, or surprise breakdowns. Your site just works.<br><br>
                    <b>Better Google Rankings:</b> Fast-loading sites rank higher in search results, helping more customers find your business.<br><br>
                    <b>True Mobile Optimization:</b> Custom code ensures your site looks perfect on every device, not just "good enough" like many WordPress themes.<br><br>
                    <b>Predictable Costs:</b> No mystery fees or sudden mandatory upgrades, you know exactly what you're paying.<br><br>
                    The bottom line: WordPress might seem cheaper upfront, but custom code delivers better results for your business and saves you headaches long-term.

                    </span>

                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    <b>Choose subscription if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer smaller, predictable monthly costs and $0 upfront<br>
                    Prefer ongoing support for edits, updates, maintenance<br>
                    Prefer someone else handling technical issues<br>
                    Want hosting and security monitoring included<br><br>
                    <b>Choose the one-time payment if you :</b><br>
                    Prefer to pay in full and own your website outright<br>
                    Can manage your own hosting and updates to contact forms etc<br>
                    Plan to make content changes yourself<br><br>
                    With subscription, the site goes offline if you cancel, but may pay for itself if you stay on (Most clients choose this).<br>
                    With the upfront option, you own your website and pay less in the long run.
                </p>

            <li class="cs-faq-item">

                        With subscription, do I pay more in the long run?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    Not necessarily — it depends on what you need.<br><br>
                    The subscription isn't a payment plan for a website. It's an ongoing service.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>One-time build ($3,000):</b> For those who need a website and are happy to manage everything after launch—edits, hosting, ongoing optimisation and future improvements.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Subscription ($150/month):</b> You're paying for a website <i>and</i> continued access to a developer. That includes hosting, content edits, security updates, performance monitoring, SEO improvements, and an optional site redesign after three years.
                    <br><br>
                    Over time, the subscription replaces costs that are often separate and unpredictable: ad-hoc developer work (for content or formatting edits), maintenance, hosting, and add-ons. Businesses reach a similar total spend within a few years, here it's with far less effort required.
                    <br><br>
                    There's no lock-in. If the subscription no longer makes sense, you can cancel at any time. The service — and the site it supports — ends with it, which is what allows the upfront cost to stay low in the first place.
                    <br><br>
                    For clients who value simplicity and ongoing optimisation, the subscription is usually the more practical option. For those who don't, the one-time build is there.

                <p class="cs-item-p">

                    Both pricing options include on-page <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization.<br><br>
                    This involves optimized page structure, title hierarchy, tags and descriptions that Google can easily scan. I use image compression, internal linking strategies, content silos, responsive design techniques, lazy loading, and clean, mobile-friendly code for fast loading. I also include local business markup so Google knows your location and can decide how to rank your website.<br><br>
                    The optional blog add-on can significantly improve SEO – you get 3 to 5 high quality blog posts every month that include targeted keywords and position your business as an authority in your industry. Search engines value blogs because they provide fresh, relevant content that adds indexed pages, addresses customer questions, and boosts organic traffic over time.

                        Do I need a blog for my website?
                    </span>
                </button>
                <p class="cs-item-p">
                    A blog helps your business in two main ways. First, it improves SEO by giving Google more pages to index, targeting keywords your customers search for, and showing your site is active and up-to-date. Second, it builds trust by demonstrating your expertise and addressing common customer questions—saving you time from answering them repeatedly.<br><br>
                    For best results, blogs need consistent posting (2–4 times per month) with content that genuinely helps your audience. With regular posts, a blog becomes one of your most valuable marketing tools.<br><br>
                    <b>Our blog add-on</b> gives you these benefits without the time investment needed to write articles yourself. Each post is thoroughly researched and crafted to be both articulate and compelling, no matter how niche your industry. Appropriate pictures and graphics are included as needed, with image compression for fast loading. This ensures your content addresses search terms that your potential customers are actually using, positioning you as the expert they're looking for.
